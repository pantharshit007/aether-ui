# Installation

<Steps>

<Step>Install Tailwind CSS</Step>

Components are styled using Tailwind CSS. Follow the [official installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) to add it to your project.

<Step>Install Motion</Step>

Components are animated using [Motion](https://motion.dev/).

```bash
npm install motion
```

<Step>Add the utility helper</Step>

Create a `lib/utils.ts` file to manage Tailwind CSS classes:

```ts
import { clsx, type ClassValue } from "clsx";
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}
```

<Step>Install icons</Step>

Add [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/) icons:

```bash
npm install @lucide-react/lucide-react
```

<Step>That's it</Step>

You can now start adding components to your project.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add "https:ui-aether.vercel.app/c/button.json"
```

The command above will add the Button component to your project. You can then import it anywhere in your project.
