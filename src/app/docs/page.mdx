# Aether UI

_Animate Your Web Presence_

Breathe life into your website with beautifully designed animated components, a collection of stunning motion components designed to captivate. <br/>
**Effortless Elegance. Limitless Customization. Open Source.**

Built for those who demand exceptional user experiences: engineers, designers, and founders.
A reusable collection of beautiful, animated components for your next productâ€”built with Motion and Tailwind CSS.

## Vision

As a developer, I noticed Tailwind CSS had already become a standard in production codebases. With the introduction of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), building modern frontends became even more accessible. Aether UI is my way of giving back, helping the community with a set of open-source, motion-driven components.

### Open sourced

[Aether UI](siteConfig.links.github) is open source. Contributions are welcome to expand and improve the collection.

_Go up and high with Aether UI._
