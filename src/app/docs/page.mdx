# Aether UI

Make your website look better with beautifully designed motion components.<br />
Easy to use. Customizable. Open Source.
Built for engineers, designers, and founders.<br />

We offer a collection of reusable animated components built with Motion and Tailwind CSS. Add smooth, engaging animations to your web projects, making them more interactive and enjoyable.

## Vision

Since, I as a developer, I was late to the party and by my time Tailwind CSS was already started to be encorporated in the production codes and with the introduction of [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/), it becomes a lot easier to move forward on frontend development. So, this is my way to contribute to the community and help the community.

### Open source and community-driven

[Aether UI](https://github.com/pantharshit007/aether-ui) is open-source. Contributions are welcome to expand and improve the collection.

_Go up and high with Aether UI._
