# This is a checklist you should follow when you are creating a new component

- [ ] Update the object in the `src/data/navigation.ts` file with the name of your component and its href.
- [ ] Create a new file in the `src/content` directory with the name of your component and the extension `.tsx`.
- [ ] Create a new folder in the `src/apps/docs` directory with the name of your component.
- [ ] Create a new file `.tsx` in the `src/apps/docs[folder]` folder with the name of your component (demo/basic).
- [ ] Create a new file `page.mdx` in the `src/docs` folder you created in the previous step.
- [ ] Fill in the metadata and all the required docs in the `page.mdx` file.
- [ ] Create a new file `[component-name].json` in the `public/c` folder.
- [ ] Fill in the required fields in the `[component-name].json` file [Be Very Careful with the naming of the fields].

## Once you are done with the above steps, check again if all things are in order.

### Now you can uncheck the checklist and commit your changes.
